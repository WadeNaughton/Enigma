# enigma

1. Functionality

  - My Encypt and Decrypt classes were implemented succesfully. These classes were used in my encrypt.rb file succesfully.
  
2. Object Oriented Programming

  - I believe my project is broken into logical componets and that my classes are not unreasonaby large. I have seperate classes for generating date and time. I am able to articulate the components of this project to an instructor.
  
3. Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

  - My code is properly indented and spaced. The spacing that is throughout the project is for easy reading. The enumberables that were chosen are doing a specifc job and I believe are the most efficient for the work. Hashes were implemented to the responses from my encryption and decryption methods.
  
4. Test Driven Development

  - My project was completed using TDD throughout. I used the tests to guide my code creations. My coverage metrics are at 100% for this project.
  
5. Version Control

  - I completed my project using two branches. One, for the actual coding of the project, and the other for reconfiguring the work and refactoring the code. I did not do a great job at commiting my work in a timely manner. The project is designed having two important methods, and I had forgot to commit once I had completed aspects of both.
  
*Overall, I would say that this would be a passing project because I followed the guidelines and submitted a working project. I faltered on some of the version control, but made up for that with solid code.
