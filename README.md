# enigma

1. Functionality

  -My Encypt and Decrypt classes were implemented succesfully. These classes were used in my encrypt.rb file succesfully.
  
2. Object Oriented Programming

  - I believe my project is broken into logical componets and that my classes are not unreasonaby large. I have seperate classes for generating date and time. I can articulate the components throughout my project.
  
3. Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

  - My code is properly indented and spaced. The enumberables that were chosen are doing a specifc job and I believe are the most efficient for the work. Hashes were implemented to store data.
  
4. Test Driven Development

  - My project was completed using TDD throughout. My coverage metrics are at 100% for this project.
  -
5. Version Control

  -I completed my project using two branches. One, for the actual coding of the project, and the other for reconfiguring the work and refactoring the code. I did not do a good job on commiting my work though.
  
- Overall, I would say that this would be a passing project because I followed the guidelines and submitted a working project. I faltered on some of the version control, but made up for that with solid code.
